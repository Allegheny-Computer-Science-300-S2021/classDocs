1. Nitrogenous bases that are purine are:

A: Adenine and Guanine

2. Nitrogenous bases that are pyrimidines are:

A: Thymine, Cytosine and Uracil

3. A five-carbon molecular structure in DNA is a... ?
A: Deoxyribose Sugar

4. A molecular structure in DNA that has four oxygens and a phosphorus is a... ?
A: Phosphate

5. How many bonds are there between Adenine and Thymine?
A: Two bonds

6. How many bonds are there between Cytosine and Guanine?
A: Three bonds

7. What is the model of DNA replication?
A: SemiConservative replication

8. DNA is replicated in the x-prime to y-prime direction. What are x and y?
A: 5' to 3' direction

9. In the DNA of certain bacterial cells, 20% of the nucleotides are adenine bases. What are the percentages of the other nucleotides in the bacterial helix of DNA?

A: A have 20%, so T's have 20%. This leaves 100% - 20% - 20% = 60%. Each of G and C take up equal amounts of this 60%, so G has 30% and C has 30%.
